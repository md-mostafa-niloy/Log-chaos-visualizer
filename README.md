Overview

Log Chaos Visualizer is a proof-of-concept Angular application intended to demonstrate client-side parsing, indexing and
visualization of large, mixed-format log files. It was implemented as a one-week hackathon/demonstration project and is
not intended for production use.

Key features

- Support for multiple log formats: Pino, Winston, Loki/Promtail, Docker JSON, and plain text.
- Interactive charts and tables showing log level distribution, kinds, and timelines.
- Structured query language with field-specific filters, boolean operators and regex support.
- Designed to handle large sample files (20k up to 200k lines) using a Web Worker for parsing and indexing.
- Convenience Python script (`generate_logs.py`) to generate synthetic log files for testing.

Demo and purpose

![screenshot2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/md-mostafa-niloy/log-chaos-visualizer/refs/heads/master/screenshots/screen_2.png)

This repository demonstrates approaches for:

- Parsing heterogeneous log formats in the browser while keeping the UI responsive (parsing done in a Web Worker).
- Building an indexed representation of logs to enable fast queries and interactive visualizations.
- Providing a compact query language that allows targeted, fielded searches with real-time validation.

Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended: current LTS)
- npm (bundled with Node.js)
- Python 3 (optional — for generating synthetic logs)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional — to run the built app behind nginx)

Quick start (development)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

2. Start the development server (live-reload)

```bash
npm start
# or
ng serve
```

3. Open the app in your browser

Visit: http://localhost:4200/

Build and run (production)

1. Build

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Serve the built files locally using the provided Dockerfile

```bash
docker build -t log-chaos-visualizer:local .
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 log-chaos-visualizer:local
```

Alternatively run with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Note: `compose.yaml` references an external Docker network named `webproxy`. If that network is not available locally
either create it with `docker network create webproxy` or remove/adjust the network section in `compose.yaml`.

Working with sample logs

The repository includes pre-generated sample files under `public/data/` (20k, 50k, 100k, 200k lines). These files are
convenient for exploring performance and UI behaviour.

Use the included Python generator to create files of custom size or format composition:

```bash
# generate 50k mixed-format logs
python3 generate_logs.py --lines 50000 --output public/data/generated-50000.log

# specify a mix of formats and a seed for reproducible output
python3 generate_logs.py --lines 20000 --output public/data/generated-20000.log --mix pino,winston,text --seed 42
```

There are convenience npm scripts that invoke the generator for the standard sample sizes (
see [Available scripts](#available-scripts)).

Query language (brief)

The application exposes a compact, structured query language for filtering and searching logs. Core capabilities
include:

- Field queries: e.g. `level=error`, `environment=prod`.
- Comparison operators: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`.
- String helpers: `contains()`, `startsWith()`, `endsWith()`, `matches()` (regex).
- Boolean logic: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` and parenthesis for grouping.
- Real-time validation and fast execution (index-backed + Web Worker).

Examples

```
level=error AND environment=prod
message.contains(api) AND message.matches(/timeout/i)
(statusCode>=500 OR statusCode=404) AND method=GET
timestamp>="2024-12-01" AND timestamp<"2024-12-07"
```

Repository layout (high-level)

- src/ — Angular application source
  - app/ — application modules, pages and shared components
  - core/ — services, workers and utilities used across the app
- public/data/ — sample log files
- generate_logs.py — Python script to produce synthetic logs
- Dockerfile, compose.yaml — container setup for static serving via nginx

Available scripts (high level)

See `package.json` for the full list; notable scripts include:

- `npm start` — start dev server (ng serve)
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run gen:logs:20k` — generate a 20k lines sample file
- `npm run gen:logs:50k` — generate a 50k lines sample file
- `npm run gen:logs:100k` — generate a 100k lines sample file
- `npm run gen:logs:200k` — generate a 200k lines sample file
- `npm run gen:logs:all` — generate all standard sample sizes sequentially

Notes, limitations and status

- This project was implemented in one week as a hackathon/demo entry and emphasizes exploration and UX over production
  concerns.
- Not production-ready: there is no authentication, limited security hardening, and minimal automated tests.
- No contributions accepted and no license file is included by owner request. The repository is provided "as-is" for
  demonstration purposes.
